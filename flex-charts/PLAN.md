# FlexCharts Development Plan

This document outlines the key considerations and features for the FlexCharts library. Each item is prioritized and has an implementation complexity estimate.

## Core Functionality

- **Wireframe Structure** [Priority: HIGH] [Complexity: MEDIUM]  
  Focus on ensuring the wireframe structure is correct and adaptable. This is foundational for all other features.

  - TODO: Create a base chart component with proper layout structure
  - TODO: Implement flexible grid system for chart positioning

- **Data Slot Mapping** [Priority: HIGH] [Complexity: MEDIUM]  
  Ensure data is mapped to the correct slots in the visualization.

  - TODO: Create data mapping system with validation
  - TODO: Support for multiple data formats and auto-detection

- **Scrolling** [Priority: HIGH] [Complexity: MEDIUM]  
  Implement smooth scrolling functionality for charts with extensive data.

  - TODO: Implement horizontal and vertical scrolling with touch support
  - TODO: Add scroll boundaries and momentum scrolling

- **Axis Labels** [Priority: HIGH] [Complexity: LOW]  
  Ensure both x-axis and y-axis labels are properly implemented and customizable.
  - TODO: Create configurable axis components
  - TODO: Add support for different label formats (text, date, numeric)

## Edge Cases and Display Issues

- **Off-Screen Data Handling** [Priority: MEDIUM] [Complexity: MEDIUM]  
  Handle how to process data that falls outside the visible area.

  - TODO: Implement virtualization for large datasets
  - TODO: Add indicator for off-screen data existence

- **Text Overflow Management** [Priority: MEDIUM] [Complexity: LOW]  
  Define behavior when text does not fit within chart elements.

  - TODO: Implement text truncation with tooltips
  - TODO: Add text resizing or wrapping options

- **Insufficient Label Space** [Priority: MEDIUM] [Complexity: MEDIUM]  
  Handle scenarios where axis labels cannot be fully rendered.

  - TODO: Implement label density reduction algorithm
  - TODO: Add smart label positioning and rotation support

- **Small Data Visualization** [Priority: LOW] [Complexity: MEDIUM]  
  Define rendering approach for data points that are too small to display clearly.
  - TODO: Create minimum size thresholds for visual elements
  - TODO: Implement aggregation for dense data clusters

## Advanced Features

- **Gantt Chart Functionality** [Priority: MEDIUM] [Complexity: HIGH]  
  Explore connecting time series boxes to create Gantt chart-like functionality.

  - TODO: Implement connector elements between timeline items
  - TODO: Add dependency relationship visualization

- **Live Editing** [Priority: LOW] [Complexity: HIGH]  
  Allow charts to be edited in real-time by users.

  - TODO: Create editing mode with direct manipulation controls
  - TODO: Implement edit history and undo functionality

- **Data Export** [Priority: LOW] [Complexity: MEDIUM]  
  Enable exporting chart data to formats like Excel.

  - TODO: Add CSV and Excel export functionality
  - TODO: Create export configuration options

- **Live Settings Adjustment** [Priority: MEDIUM] [Complexity: MEDIUM]  
  Allow users to modify chart settings in real-time.

  - TODO: Build settings panel component
  - TODO: Implement live preview for setting changes

- **Dynamic Data Points** [Priority: MEDIUM] [Complexity: HIGH]  
  Support adding or removing data points on the fly.
  - TODO: Create API for dynamic data manipulation
  - TODO: Add animations for data point changes

## Customization

- **Custom Rendering** [Priority: HIGH] [Complexity: HIGH]  
  Support custom rendering for all chart elements.

  - TODO: Create rendering override system with default fallbacks
  - TODO: Document custom rendering API

- **CSS Customization** [Priority: MEDIUM] [Complexity: MEDIUM]  
  Determine the CSS approach and customization capabilities.
  - TODO: Evaluate CSS-in-JS vs. class-based styling
  - TODO: Create theme system with defaults and custom options

## Special Visualizations

- **Position-Only Data Points** [Priority: LOW] [Complexity: LOW]  
  Support for pure positional data points without visual representation.

  - TODO: Implement invisible anchor points system
  - TODO: Add interaction capabilities for position points

- **Calendar Integration** [Priority: LOW] [Complexity: HIGH]  
  Export data to calendar formats and potentially create calendar views.
  - TODO: Research calendar format standards
  - TODO: Create calendar view component using the same data format

## Performance Optimization

- **Infinite Data Scrolling** [Priority: MEDIUM] [Complexity: HIGH]  
  Support for extremely large datasets (e.g., historical events from year 0 to 2000).

  - TODO: Implement data windowing system
  - TODO: Create smart data loading with prefetching and caching

- **View Optimization** [Priority: MEDIUM] [Complexity: MEDIUM]  
  Animate and remove rows that are no longer visible to optimize performance.
  - TODO: Create visibility detection system
  - TODO: Implement smooth enter/exit animations for chart elements

## Additional Considerations

- What is the most sensible CSS engine approach?
- Should we maintain a separate calendar view with the same data format?
- How do we handle accessibility requirements for all chart types?
